Moritz creates scores in the score's root folder as:
	a) a series of printable, page-numbered .svg pages (contained in an HTML file).
	b) **TODO**: an un-numbered .svg file containing all the systems.
These files are all overwritten without warning, when Moritz (re-)compiles the score.
So, when adding annotations:
1. create a new "annotated" folder inside the score's root folder, and copy the page-numbered .svg files there.
2. edit and save these annotated/page-numbered .svg files.
   If more vertical space is needed, change the page height as follows:
      a) select the top element in Inkscape's XML editor
	  b) in the editor's left panel, change the height value to an integral number of pixels as required, and the final viewBox value to (height * 8).
	  c) either edit the rect on the frame layer (layer1)correspondingly, or delete the frame layer completely.
3. Either manually copy all the systems to a new, single svg page having the name of the score without " Page <pageNumber>" (but with an .svg suffix),
   or **TODO**: Moritz provides a utility for moving systems from a series of page-numbered .svg files into a single .svg file containing
         all the systems. Use this on the result of editing the single pages. The resulting file will be saved next to the page-numbered
         .svg files. The utility preserves the annotations.

**TODO** The Assistant Performer uses the first score it finds, when looking at locations in the following order:
	1. score root file/annotated/un-numbered .svg file
	2. score root file/annotated/page-numbered .svg files
	3. score root file/un-numbered .svg file
	4. score root file/page-numbered .svg files

Scores can be edited as follows in Inkscape:

1. The Assistant Performer ignores:
	a) all layers except the 'score' layer.
	b) all id attributes except those inside the <defs> element (used to identify particular clef and flag definitions).
	   id attributes are, however useful as comments when editing in Inkscape, and should be maintained.
	b) all objects that have no class (see below).
	d) all classes (e.g. barline) that are not listed below.
	c) all attributes (e.g. color) that a classed object does not originally have.
	Such items and values can therefore be added and changed ad lib.

	ID attributes are not used by the Assistant Performer, but they are useful hints when editing in Inkscape,
	so should also be maintained. Moritz uses the following conventions for the following groups:
       system: sys<systemNumber> (sys1, sys2 etc.) The numbers are top to bottom, relative to the page.
	   staff connectors: sys<systemNumber>connectors
	   outputStaff and inputStaff: sys<systemNumber>staff<staffNumber> ( sys1staff3, sys4staff1 etc.)
	       <staffNumber> is regardless of staff type, and is top to bottom, relative to the system.
	   stafflines: sys<systemNumber>staff<staffNumber>stafflines ( sys1staff3stafflines, sys4staff1stafflines etc.)
       outputVoice and inputVoice: sys<systemNumber>staff<staffNumber>voice<voiceNumber> ( sys1staff3voice1, sys4staff1voice2 etc.)
           <voiceNumber> is either 1 or 2, and is top to bottom, relative to the staff.

2. Editing the 'score' layer:
   The following group types have a 'class' attribute, set by Moritz, that is used by the Assistant Performer:
        system,
		outputStaff,
		inputStaff,
		stafflines,
		outputVoice,
		inputVoice,
		outputChord,
		inputChord,
		rest.
   If any of these is ungrouped while editing, the class attribute must be reset when the group is regrouped.
   It is only necessary to group and ungroup systems when adding text or slurs.

   A simple edit session goes like this:   
   a) Unlock the 'score' layer.
   b) Ungroup the system to be edited.
   c) Move the staff groups up and down as necessary (without ungrouping them), adding text, slurs etc. ad lib. in the
      newly available space. Any new objects will be ignored by the Assistant Performer.
   d) To reconnect the staff connectors:
         1. ungroup the connectors group (id:sys<systemNumber>connectors)
		 2. convert the selected lines to paths (using the Object to Path command from the Path menu).
		 3. select the paths tool (the selected paths now show their nodes)
		 4. select horizontally aligned path nodes by drawing a marquee (with the paths tool)
		 5. ctl-drag, or use the (shift)-arrow keys to move the nodes up or down.
		 6. regroup all the system's connectors, and set the group's id to sys<systemNumber>connectors
   e) Regroup the system, and reset its class (to 'system') and id (to 'sys<systemNumber>').
   f) Possibly redistribute the systems vertically. Either by eye, or using the Align tools.
   g) Re-lock the 'score' layer.
