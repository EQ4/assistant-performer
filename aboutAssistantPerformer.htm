            Assistant Performer (web version)</p>
        <p class="boldHeader2">
            Summary</p>
        The aim of this project is to give a single performer maximum control over the performance
        of a music score displayed in a browser.<br />
        The project is written in HTML5 and Javascript. Webkit browsers (Chrome and Safari)
        are supported. Other browsers may work too, but this is not guaranteed.<br />
        MIDI devices are used for input and output.<br />
        <br />
        The idea for a <a href="http://james-ingram-act-two.de/open-source/assistantPerformer/assistantPerformer.html">
            web version of the Assistant Performer</a> arose while working on an earlier
        <a href="../../moritz2/assistantPerformer/assistantPerformer.html">desktop application</a>.
        Unlike its predecessor, the web application can use an advanced set of options and
        tools to control the playback of the displayed score. Building on these capabilities,
        users will eventually be able to play scores live, in their own time, using their
        own MIDI input and output devices.<br />
        A simple application would be like ordinary music-minus-one played in private, but
        with the live performer in control of the timing (think Mozart’s Clarinet concerto).
        Other applications include playing specially written scores, possibly with other
        players, in live concerts; controlling robot orchestras, etc.<br />
        <br />
        This project is part of an effort to re-enable writing as a means of creating large-scale
        structures in music. Music notation collapsed in the 20th century, with catastrophic
        results...<br />
        <br />
        <p class="boldHeader2">
            Some details</p>
        The MIDI input and output devices can be selected from those attached to the user&rsquo;s
        computer. At the moment, this is done using the <a href="http://jazz-soft.net/">Jazz</a>
        plugin and <a href="https://github.com/abudaan/JazzMIDIBridge">JazzMIDIBridge</a>
        wrapper code, so <span style="color: #FF0000">the Jazz plugin currently has to be installed
            before using this application</span>. But this restriction should eventually
        be removed when browsers implement the standard MIDI API for browsers being developed
        by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/audio/">W3C Audio Group</a> (October 2012).<br />
        Note that the live performer&rsquo;s control over the score need not be just via
        MIDI note-on and note-off messages. The use of continuous controllers is also forseen.<br />
        <br />
        The score is in a <a href="http://james-ingram-act-two.de/open-source/svgScoreExtensions.html">
            hybrid SVG-MIDI format</a>. Such scores could, in principle, be loaded from
        anywhere on the web &mdash; if they existed anywhere else but on this
        site.<br />
        The development of authoring software for such scores is a separate issue, which
        will doubtless be the subject of a future project here. At the moment (October 2012),
        I am using my <a href="../../moritz2/assistantComposer/assistantComposer.html">
            Assistant Composer</a> software, but it would be perfectly feasible for the
        standard music notation editors (Finale, Sibelius, capella etc.) to export in this
        format. Standard music notation is a superset of the required notation. The Assistant
        Performer simply ignores annotations such as performance instructons or tuplet symbols.
        The Assistant Composer already creates such scores on the basis of abstract MIDI
        information, so automatic transcription of Standard MIDI files is also a distinct
        possibility.<br />

            Acknowlegements</p>
        <ul class="ulStandard">
            <li>I would like to thank the authors of Jazz and JazzMIDIBridge for being able to use
                their software. Wonderful stuff! Without them, this project would not have got off
                the ground. </li>
            <li>This <a href="http://www.cursor.cc/">beautiful cursor editor</a> deserves a mention.
                I used it to create the Assistant Performer&rsquo;s "Set Start Marker" and "Set
                End Marker" tools. Unfortunately, (most?) browsers currently insist that a cursor&rsquo;s
                hot-spot has to be at the top left corner of the cursor, so my cursors turned out
                very simply. But that may change in future. </li>
            <li>Last but by no means least, I would like to thank the public W3C Audio List. I'm
                often a bit out of my depth there, but have learned a lot trying to understand what
                they are doing. Many thanks for your patience! </li>
