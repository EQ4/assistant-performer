The aim of this project is to give a single performer maximum control over the performance of a music score displayed in a browser.

The project is written in HTML5 and Javascript. Only webkit browsers (Chrome and Safari) are currently supported. MIDI devices are used for input and output.

There is a version of this application on the web at

http://james-ingram-act-two.de/open-source/publicAssistantPerformer/assistantPerformer.html

This is the version accessible from my web site. It is stable, and can be used by the general public to try out those parts of the program that have been implemented so far. Feedback from users is always important.

Note that this version will not usually represent the latest state of the software in this repository. I do my day-to-day testing elsewhere, and not all test versions are suitable for immediate public consumption. This repository is, however, kept up to date with the latest changes.
