The aim of this project is to give a single performer maximum control over the performance of a music score displayed in a browser.

The project is written in HTML5 and Javascript, uses MIDI input and output devices, and scores stored in an SVG format which has been enhanced to contain MIDI information.

The Jazz plugin [1] is currently required for MIDI support, but this will change when browsers implement the new WEB MIDI API currently being discussed on the public forum of the W3C Audio Group [2].

Currently only the webkit browsers (Chrome and Safari) are supported.

This repository contains the code for the above application. Day-to-day testing is done elsewhere.
