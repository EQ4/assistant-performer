The aim of this project is to give a single performer maximum control over the performance of a music score displayed in a browser.

The project is written in HTML5 and Javascript, uses MIDI input and output devices, and scores stored in an SVG format which has been enhanced to contain MIDI information.

The Jazz plugin [1] is currently required for MIDI support, but this will change when browsers implement the new WEB MIDI standard currently being discussed on the public forum of the W3C Audio Group [2].

Currently only the webkit browsers (Chrome and Safari) are supported.

This project is a work-in-progress. There is a working, but incomplete version on the web at

http://james-ingram-act-two.de/open-source/publicAssistantPerformer/assistantPerformer.html

This version can be used by anyone wanting to try out those parts of the program that have been implemented so far. Feedback from users is always important.

This repository contains the code for the above application. Day-to-day testing is done elsewhere.
