Questions for the W3C:

1. Should Ports support opening and closing? (JazzMIDIBridge does, with an isOpen attribute,
   but I think Jazz 1.2 is doing this automatically so as to ensure that ports are not
   opened twice.

2. In JazzWebMIDI, complying with the current spec, MIDIOutput has a function which can be
   called like this:
		outputDevice.send(midiEvent.data, domhrtTimestamp);
   Jazz's MidiOutLong() does not take a timestamp argument, so it is always ignored. Jazz sends
   the data immediately. Jazz does however support SysEx events, so this would also work:
        outputDevice.send(sysExEvent.data, domhrtTimestamp);

4. The current spec says (section 7.3.1):
   "Running status is not allowed in the data, as underlying systems may not support it."
   But some systems MAY support it, so why do we have to rule it out?
   Do some MIDI devices fail to ignore these events if they can't understand them?
   My Event class can contain 1-byte data, and Jazz supports this too...

TODO:
a) Write SMFToSequence(StandardMIDIFile) in StandardMIDIFile.js
b) Documentation: Write some simple examples. For example, how to stop and start playing an smf
